\textbf{NOTE}

All that this package does, is configure the \verb|listings| package for you. If anything is not working the way you want it, refer to the \verb|listings| documentation first and a look at the \verb|mcode.sty| file itself, which is well documented internally.

\textbf{Installation of the package}

As with any other package, just place the \verb|mcode.sty| file in the same folder as your document, or put it somewhere where \LaTeX{} can find it.  That's all!

\medskip

\textbf{Usage --- 3 ways}

1) This inline demo \mcode{for i=1:3, disp('cool'); end;} uses the \verb|\mcode{}| command.

2) The following is a block using the \verb|lstlisting| environment.
\begin{lstlisting}
for i = 1:3
	if i >= 5                    % literate programming replacement
		disp('cool');           % comment with some ยง\mcommentfont\LaTeX in it: $\mcommentfont\pi x^2$ยง
	end
	[~,ind] = max(vec);
	x_last = x(1,end);
	v(end);
	really really long really really long really really long really really long really really long line % blaaaaaaaa
end
\end{lstlisting}
Note: Here, the package was loaded with the \verb|framed|, \verb|numbered|, \verb|autolinebreaks| and \verb|useliterate| options.  \textbf{Please see the top of mcode.sty for a detailed explanation of these options.}


3) Finally, you can also directly include an external m-file from somewhere on your hard drive (the very code you use in \textsc{Matlab}, if you want) using the \verb|\lstinputlisting{/SOME/PATH/FILENAME.M}| command.  If you only want to include certain lines from that file (for instance to skip a header), you can use \verb|\lstinputlisting[firstline=6, lastline=15]{/SOME/PATH/FILENAME.M}|.
